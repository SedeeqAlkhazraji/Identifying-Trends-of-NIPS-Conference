# Identifying-Trends-of-NIPS-Conference
Use Natural Language Processing on NIPS papers to uncover the trendiest topics in machine learning research.

Project Description
Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, We analyze a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to discover the latest trends in machine learning. The techniques used here to handle large amounts of data can be applied to other text datasets as well.

Project Tasks
*Loading the NIPS papers
*Preparing the data for analysis
-Plotting how machine learning has evolved over time
- Preprocessing the text data
* A word cloud to visualize the preprocessed text data
* Prepare the text for LDA analysis
* Analysing trends with LDA
* The future of machine learning
